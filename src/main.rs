// The Rust community has developed guidelines for splitting the separate concerns of a binary program when main
// starts getting large. This process has the following steps:
// - Split your program into a main.rs and a lib.rs and move your programâ€™s logic to lib.rs.
// - As long as your command line parsing logic is small, it can remain in main.rs.
// - When the command line parsing logic starts getting complicated, extract it from main.rs and move it to lib.rs.
//
// The responsibilities that remain in the main function after this process should be limited to the following:
// - Calling the command line parsing logic with the argument values
// - Setting up any other configuration
// - Calling a run function in lib.rs
// - Handling the error if run returns an error
//
// This pattern is about separating concerns: main.rs handles running the program, and lib.rs handles all the logic
// of the task at hand.
